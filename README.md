Simply unzip `dataset.zip` into the current directory, or you can create your own dataset following the structure in the dataset directory. If you have any questions about the dataset file, you can ask me for the code to create the dataset.

To obtain the initial decision map, binary decision map, and score map, simply run `decisionMap.py`.

The training code is in `train.py`
